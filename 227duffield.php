                        227 Abolitionist place is the historical site from the underground railroad. In the past, it was home to the abolitionist couple the Truesdells, who helped an unknown number of slaves flee to freedom in Canada. In modern times, it belonged to activist Joy Chatel, who successfully won an eminent domain suit against the city government. New York City wanted to demolish the historical 227 Abolitionist places and build a parking lot. Our class partnered with the Brooklyn Historical Society and 227 Abolitionist places to pitch ideas to the museum of how they can increase awareness of the historical site.</p>

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">While a grad student at NYU, one of my professors partnered with the site and the Brooklyn Historical Society. The goal of this project was to design an interactive experience relates to African-American history of the underground railway located at Duffield St in Brooklyn, New York in an user-centered way. After three months of research, ideation and iterating, we decided to design a way-finding system mixed with a guerilla art project to raise the interest of the historic site in Brooklyn Heights</p>

Research is key to the success of any project, and research leads our project throughout the entire design process. In the beginning, it was essential for us to understand three things:</p> 

<ol class="text-white-50 mb-0">
    <li>Who would our key users be</li>
    <li>What brings people to exhibits similar to our clients,</li>
    <li>The sensitive history of our site.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-white-50 mb-0">
To do this, we first built a timeline of the site by digging into the public records available for 227 Duffield. We then interviewed patrons of two museums near our site visiting a similar exhibit, we interviewed experts and academics about the underground railroad in Brooklyn, and we conducted surveys on people in the neighborhood.

                <h2>Research Results</h2>
                <p class="text-white-50 text-left">We started the design process by diving deep into researching about the site history. To understand about current preferences of museum visitors, we visited Brooklyn museum and Brooklyn historical society and interviewed more than 30 people and conducted a short survey to analyze our findings. We hoped to learn more about the Underground Railroad hence we interviewed some experts and academicians too. </p>

                    After a few weeks of users interviews, pouring through old documents at the Brooklyn Historical Society, and interviews with experts, a problem began to emerge. The issue was that people who lived near 227 Duffield Place were fascinated by the history of the Underground Railroad but rarely were aware of the Abolitionist Place and its role in the underground railroad. Even when users where aware, they tended to be frustrated because information about the site was so hard to come by.

            <h2>Ideation + How Might We</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Based on the results of our research, we defined a persona and segments, concepts that will be all too familiar to anyone in the marketing world. Again, because our problem centered around the idea of awareness, we brainstormed ideas that would bring attention to the site and educate the immediate area. Inspired by the barns that span the Underground railroad in the Midwest, we realized that there is already iconology associated with the underground railroad. We realized that the image of a quilt was deeply connected with the Underground Railroad, and decided to use quilt patterns to build an interactive physical prototype which people could play with easily and tested it out with users.</p>

            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Our testing results revealed that the patterns definitely captured the attention of the people walking by and they wanted to know more about the Brooklyn history. We realized that we need to design a navigation system which guides the users to follow the patterns as a wayfinding mechanism. Our concept was based on the idea that allowed users to create their own path to the museum by looking for the patterns.</p>

            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">By keeping in mind our target users based on our segments and persona, we designed the user journey. It involved looking into touch points, emotions, pain points, drivers and opportunities faced by the users. Each of these steps helped us understand the user flow in detail and map it all onto the ecosystem diagram. We mapped out the user journey right from noticing the pattern to finding next location, visiting the website to learning about the abolitionist place. This helped us understand the entities and various factors involved in the entire process and to design by keeping the constraints and goals in mind.</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">As part of designing the wayfinding experience, we created a mobile website which helped the users learn more about the history of the Abolitionist Place and Museum, what the quilt patterns represented and how to use them as a key to finding next locations on the route. It also had a map section which helped users locate themselves in real time, showed the route to the museum and helped navigate to the next location using the patterns at each location. We tested the design with multiple users and found that users were able to decipher the patterns easily and the patterns captured their attention at several locations. Our next steps include adding more locations connected to the Underground Railroad and include chapters or episodes in the wayfinding system to generate more interest and awareness among the users. </p>
