                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">227 Abolitionist place is historical site from the underground railroad with a rich history in times both modern and past. In the past, it was home to the abolisionist couple the Truesdells, who helped an unknown number of slaves flee to freedom in Canada. In modern times, it belonged to activist Joy Chatel, who succesfully won an eminate domain suite against the city when they wanted to demolish the historical 227 Abolitionist place and build a parking lot. Our class partnered with the Brooklyn Historical Society and 227 Abolitionist place to pitch ideas to the museum of how they can increase awareness of the historical site.</p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">The goal of this project was to design an interactive experience relates to <em>African-American history</em> of the <em>underground railway</em> located at Duffield St in Brooklyn, New York in an user-centered way. After three months of research, ideation and iterating, we decided to design a way-finding system mixed with a guerilla art project to raise interest of the historical site in Brooklyn Heights</p>

In the beginning, it was essential for us to understand three things: who would our key users be, what brings people to exhibits similar to our clients, and the sensitive history of our site. To do this, we interviewed patrons of two museums near our site visiting a similar exhibit, we interviewed experts and academics about the underground railroad in Brooklyn, and we conducted surveys on people in the neighborhood.

To understand about current preferences of museum visitors, we visited Brooklyn museum and Brooklyn historical society and interviewed more than 30 people and conducted a short survey to analyze our findings. We hoped to learn more about the Underground Railroad hence we interviewed some experts and academicians too. </p>

            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">After a few weeks of users interviews, pouring through old documents at the Brooklyn Historical Society, and interviews with experts, a problem began to emerge. The issue was that people who lived near 227 Duffield Place were fascinated by the history of the Underground Railroad but rarely were aware of the Abolitionist Place and its role in the underground railroad. Even when users where aware, they tended to be frustrated because information about the site was so hard to come by.</p>

            <h2>Ideation + How Might We</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Originally the scope of this project was just meant to be a redesign of the mobile app, but as designing the app and talking to users, we recognized a problem: How to you design a modern app, modeled after a webapp, when the webapp itself needs an update? I decided to do a quick reskinning of what I thought the webapp could look like if we were to keep the general UX, but update it to be a little more modern. Then I took that card based design, from the site and modeled the app after it. This project is still ongoing, but weâ€™ve made a lot of progress. Currently the dev team is working on implementing the signon process that I designed, and I am working on designing out each page based on the approved mockup above. </p>
            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Based on our research and user interviews, we created the above segments and targeted persona. To address our problem statement of creating awareness among people about the site, we brainstormed a bunch of ideas ranging from interactive experiences to navigation and installations. We came across quilt patterns and realized that they were deeply connected with the Underground Railroad. We decided to use the patterns to build an interactive physical prototype which people could play with easily and tested it out with users.</p>

            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Our testing results revealed that the patterns definitely captured the attention of the people walking by and they wanted to know more about the Brooklyn history. We realized that we need to design a navigation system which guides the users to follow the patterns as a way finding mechanism. Our concept was based on the idea that allowed users to create their own path to the museum by looking for the patterns.</p>

            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">By keeping in mind our target users based on our segments and persona, we designed the user journey. It involved looking into touch points, emotions, pain points, drivers and opportunities faced by the users. Each of these steps helped us understand the user flow in detail and map it all onto the ecosystem diagram. We mapped out the user journey right from noticing the pattern to finding next location, visiting the website to learning about the abolitionist place. This helped us understand the entities and various factors involved in the entire process and to design by keeping the constraints and goals in mind.</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50 text-left">As part of designing the way finding experience, we created a mobile website which helped the users learn more about the history of the Abolitionist Place and Museum, what the quilt patterns represented and how to use them as a key to find next locations on the route. It also had a map section which helped users locate themselves in real time, showed the route to the museum and helped navigate to the next location using the patterns at each location. We tested the design with multiple users and found that users were able to decipher the patterns easily and the patterns captured their attention at several locations. Our next steps include adding more locations connected to underground rail road and include chapters or episodes in the way finding system to generate more interest and awareness among the users. </p>
