            <h2>Project Summary</h2>

            <p>227 Abolitionist place is historical site from the underground railroad with a rich history in times both modern and past. In the past, it was home to the abolisionist couple the Truesdells, who helped an unknown number of slaves flee to freedom in Canada. In modern times, it belonged to activist Joy Chatel, who succesfully won an eminate domain suite against the city when they wanted to demolish the historical 227 Abolitionist place and build a parking lot. Our class partnered with the Brooklyn Historical Society and 227 Abolitionist place to pitch ideas to the museum of how they can increase awareness of the historical site.</p>

            <p>The goal of this project was to design an interactive experience relates to <em>African-American history</em> of the <em>underground railway</em> located at Duffield St in Brooklyn, New York in an user-centered way. After three months of research, ideation and iterating, we decided to design a way-finding system mixed with a guerilla art project to raise interest of the historical site in Brooklyn Heights</p>

                <p>Research is key to the success of any project, and research lead our project throughout the entire design process. In the beginning, it was essential for us to understand three things: who would our key users be, what brings people to exhibits similar to our clients, and the sensitive history of our site. To do this, we interviewed patrons of two museums near our site visiting a similar exhibit, we interviewed experts and academics about the underground railroad in Brooklyn, and we conducted surveys on people in the neighborhood. </p>

            <p>After a few weeks of users interviews, pouring through old documents at the Brooklyn Historical Society, and interviews with experts, a problem began to emerge. The issue was that people who lived near 227 Duffield Place were fascinated by the history of the Underground Railroad but rarely were aware of the Abolitionist Place and its role in the underground railroad. Even when users where aware, they tended to be frustrated because information about the site was so hard to come by.</p>

            <p>We extracted the segments from our user research and start to sort out our persona. The segments help us to uncover the patterns of use and trends in behavior that would otherwise be masked when lumping together the data for all visitors to the site. A major strength of personas is that they focus design efforts around user types and their specific needs or behaviors, and facilitate discussions among team members and stakeholders. </p>

                <p>Originally the scope of this project was just meant to be a redesign of the mobile app, but as designing the app and talking to users, we recognized a problem: How to you design a modern app, modeled after a webapp, when the webapp itself needs an update? I decided to do a quick reskinning of what I thought the webapp could look like if we were to keep the general UX, but update it to be a little more modern. Then I took that card based design, from the site and modeled the app after it. This project is still ongoing, but weâ€™ve made a lot of progress. Currently the dev team is working on implementing the signon process that I designed, and I am working on designing out each page based on the approved mockup above. </p>
