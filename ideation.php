                        As a UX Designer, I am constantly designing screens and interactions. And just as regularly as I design, new technology comes out to make it easier to create interactions. Currently, I am really interested in the power of Framer X. There are a lot of tools in there that make it easier to create animations using HTML, and React. I'm really interested in learning React, and I think that mastering Framer X could be a great way to do that. So here's my project, I want to create a new interaction each week, with protptyping tools like Framer X, After Effects and Principle.<br><br> The desire is that this will make me both a better designer, and developer. It should also make me a lot quicker at what I do.

                        As a creative that is costantly learning from evern more creative people around me. I really appreciated this video. I have always felt that just because something exsists, or because something has been done before, doesn't mean that it can't be improved, or reinterpretated. From a commercial perspective, facebook was a total rip off of mySpace and Friendster, but those two platforms never could have risen to the level of popularity of facebook, because facebook was cued into the needs and trends of users in a unique way.<br><br> At the same time, I have had my work stollen without attribution, or payment and I recognize how frustrating that can be. And there needs to be protections for artists. <br><br> Though I broadly agree with the content of this video, I will say that it was positioned in a way to make it seem like the public domain is suffering, and creativity is being stiffeled by IP and Copywrite law. But there are huge communities of coders, writers, photographers and artists that belive in the power of open works. Creative Commons has a massive library of works. And for every for-profit Javascript library, there is a comparable opensource version for developers to at least wet their feet with. I feel like people are responding to the restrictions of IP law by creating works that are open and free to use by the public. People are commited to keeping the public domain healthy and thriving, even if corperations aren't.

                                Curiosity is the parent of innovation. Every great idea starts with simple curiosity, often that curiosity grows into a research topic, question or even product.<br><br>I've been thinking a lot lately about point clouds, and some of the applications of openframeworks. SO I started by building the mood board in Pinterest and collected inspiration from all over.<br><br>
                                I then broke open an old program that I wrote in C++ for my Creative Coding Class and generated a point cloud using a Kinect. I then pulled that point cloud into illustrator and laser printed it onto a slat of birchwood.
