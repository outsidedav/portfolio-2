                        As a UX Designer, I am constantly designing screens and interactions. And just as regularly as I design, new technology comes out to make it easier to create interactions. Currently, I am really interested in the power of Framer X. There are a lot of tools in there that make it easier to create animations using HTML, and React. I'm really interested in learning React, and I think that mastering Framer X could be a great way to do that. So here's my project, I want to create a new interaction each week, with protptyping tools like Framer X, After Effects and Principle.<br><br> The desire is that this will make me both a better designer, and developer. It should also make me a lot quicker at what I do.

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
                        As a creative that is costantly learning from evern more creative people around me. I really appreciated this video. I have always felt that just because something exsists, or because something has been done before, doesn't mean that it can't be improved, or reinterpretated. From a commercial perspective, facebook was a total rip off of mySpace and Friendster, but those two platforms never could have risen to the level of popularity of facebook, because facebook was cued into the needs and trends of users in a unique way.<br><br> At the same time, I have had my work stollen without attribution, or payment and I recognize how frustrating that can be. And there needs to be protections for artists. <br><br> Though I broadly agree with the content of this video, I will say that it was positioned in a way to make it seem like the public domain is suffering, and creativity is being stiffeled by IP and Copywrite law. But there are huge communities of coders, writers, photographers and artists that belive in the power of open works. Creative Commons has a massive library of works. And for every for-profit Javascript library, there is a comparable opensource version for developers to at least wet their feet with. I feel like people are responding to the restrictions of IP law by creating works that are open and free to use by the public. People are commited to keeping the public domain healthy and thriving, even if corperations aren't.

                        Curiosity is the parent of innovation. Every great idea starts with simple curiosity, often that curiosity grows into a research topic, question or even product.<br><br>I've been thinking a lot lately about point clouds, and some of the applications of openframeworks. SO I started by building the mood board in Pinterest and collected inspiration from all over.<br><br> I then broke open an old program that I wrote in C++ for my Creative Coding Class and generated a point cloud using a Kinect. I then pulled that point cloud into illustrator and laser printed it onto a slat of birchwood.

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
                        I just finished watching a show called Maniac, and though I normally wouldn't admit binging a Netflix show for a class assignment, kept thinking about the way the writer and director, Cary Fukunaga, used objects to drive the storyline.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">

                        In this show, all three of the frameworks are used to personify objects; one of the main characters is a computer AI played by Sally Feilds, that has been given emotions to help diagnose people with mental illnesses. That computer acts as an oracle that has the power to diagnose you, and tell you things about yourself that you never could learn on your own. Like an oracle, it sees through you and understands you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">

                        The computer also acts as a subject, she is driven mad by other peoples emotions, and has a personality that is very important to the plot. And the entire show uses technology as a portal to transfer the viewer into a nostalgic view of the 80s.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
                        The role of technology in storytelling may be obvious in this example; you can use tech to set the time and place of a narrative or use it to add plot points. But what I liked about the article "If this Toaster Could Talk" is it made me realize how important it is that a technology has its own narrative. This is interesting to me because of a conversation I had with a friend this week about this power, and potential problems surrounding the fact that we as humans frame mental models with narratives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
                        She made a great point and pointed out that "data without narrative, is just noise." We need storytelling to help us put data in context and help us understand what we can do with that data, or how it affects our lives. Maybe it works the same way with tech. Can we make sense of technology without a narrative? Do we assign stories, and frameworks of our own when we learn a new technology?
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">

                        These are all interesting questions that came to mind as I read the article assigned in class. And I don't know if there is one straightforward answer to any of them. What is evident to me, that wasn't before, is how vital storytelling and narrative is to understand technology and that we need to plan for that as designers who introduce new technology to market.

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
                        I first brought in an ice cream scooper with the hopes of redesigning it, it can be frustrating how while scooping your ice cream, sometimes you apply too much pressure and fling the ice cream. I have since realized that is just because I have purchased really cheap ice cream scoopers.

                        Then, while working on an AR project with a friend of mine, realized that it is kind of crazy that in 2018 we still tie our shoes the same way that we have for the last... I dont know... thousand years &#40;still needs to be fact checked&#41; <br>
                        In this project, we are using AR to change the color and pattern on an Air Force 1. I thought that it might be cool if the next verson of this shoe had a better system for tying your shoe. One of the most frustrating part of the shoe, is the laces, the laces tend to come untied multible times a day.<br>
                        Currently the only solution for this is to double knot it, or to get shoes with velcro. <br>
                        Now I don't think Air Force 1's would look as good with velcro, so I recomend using laces, but adding a latch at the end of the lace that ties into it's self without a knot.
                        <br>
                        That way you can have the style of laces, but with the reliability of velcro.
