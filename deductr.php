      <p>deductr is a web and mobile app that tracks–you guessed it–deductions. The Salt Lake City based company has already helped tens of thousands of self employed entrepreneurs track their deduction through their desktop webapp, but recognized the need for a update to their web UI, and a complete redesign of their mobile app.</p>

        <h2 class="project-page-h2">Previous App Design</h2>
        
      <p>Though functional for thousands of users, the previous web app was a mix of skeuomorphism and flat design, this is it's much needed update. Discussions with users revealed a frustration with the outdated design, and the lack of ease of use. Users wanted more features from the webapp on the mobile app, including banklink. But loved mobile feature such as automatic mileage tracking that some of our competitors had. After discussions with the client and developers, we set some realistic and measurable goals, and then started building a backlog.</p>

        <p>One of out first goals, was to take a look at the way information was organized on the app, and address the Information Architecture. After employing card sorting, user interviewing, and meetings with stakeholders to identify areas of strength and areas that can be improved, I created this flow map the guide the direction of design and development.</p>

      <h2 class="project-page-h2">Style Guide</h2>
      <p>The next goal was to create a general look and feel that could be applied to both the web app and mobile app, and guide the direction of my detailed designs. I started by revisiting the branding, fonts and colors. Many of which had been already employed, but not standardized.  It was also important to the client that the redesign left room for growth and change overtime, and that worked the same on all platforms. We decided to use a modular styled material design, with cards that the user could potentially customize to fit their needs.</p>
