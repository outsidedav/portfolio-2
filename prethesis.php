                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">This article establishes this idea that Fake news isn’t the only problem, it’s at the root of the problem, but the problem can just as well be attributed to “low quality” news as it can be to fake news. This paper explores this idea, and proves the concept that the media landscape available in the United States affects the government we get. Is it any surprise that in the age of twitter, and meme, we got the embodiment of that culture as a president?</p>

If there is a way to make it more economical advantages to keep your daughter in school, then that is probably the best way to deter the practice. <br><br>The other thing that came to mind is that i noticed while reading this study, and while researching others, that a common issue is the fact that these girls do not have birth certificates. If there was a way for police officers to check a database, and actually verify the age of these girls, then I suspect that that would avoid a lot of cases.

These men where pioneers in there feild and framed the way that we think about UXD today, and they were HUGE advocates of rapid prototyping.
