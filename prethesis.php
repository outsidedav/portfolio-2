                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">This article establishes this idea that Fake news isn’t the only problem, it’s at the root of the problem, but the problem can just as well be attributed to “low quality” news as it can be to fake news. This paper explores this idea, and proves the concept that the media landscape available in the United States affects the government we get. Is it any surprise that in the age of twitter, and meme, we got the embodiment of that culture as a president?</p>

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Fox news is not what interests me in this study necessarily, but rather the idea that media bias affects the way that we vote.

If there is a way to make it more economical advantages to keep your daughter in school, then that is probably the best way to deter the practice. <br><br>The other thing that came to mind is that i noticed while reading this study, and while researching others, that a common issue is the fact that these girls do not have birth certificates. If there was a way for police officers to check a database, and actually verify the age of these girls, then I suspect that that would avoid a lot of cases.

Don Norman, David Kelly from IDEO, Bryan Lawson and of course Peter Rowe, who first used the term Design Thinking as the title of his book about architecture. These men where pioneers in there feild and framed the way that we think about UXD today, and they were HUGE advocates of rapid prototyping. So what if they had all the same tools that we have at our advantage today? What if they had AR, or a hololens? How would they use the technology to inprove the design process?<br></p>

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
                    Right now I’m exploring Mental models, within the context of design thinking. Currently, a lot of focus is put on testing, and working with users, but the emphasis isn’t necessarily about mapping mental models. I would like to know they are formed, and how a designers mental model differs from that of a users.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve noticed that a lot of graphic designers and engineers assume that they know how the user would respond to a process, or workflow, without talking to the user. Designers and Engineers have a mental model in their head, but the problem is that that model rarely actually matches the users. Sometimes users can use intuition to figure out the tasks they need to perform in order to successfully navigate a program, as they do this they are constructing a mental model, and making decisions based on how they understand the software. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, what happens when the software becomes more complicated is that users are no longer able to just intuit a mental model together, they require training. Sometimes this training is just a list of rote tasks that leads to a result. The user doesn’t understand what is happening under the hood, they just know that if they press this and that, something will happen. One of the papers I read shows how this form of rote memorization means that people quickly forget how to use the software, whereas when people actually understand what x or y button is doing under the hood, when they have a mental model, they are able to both perform the tasks faster, and they remember how to user the software longer.

                    I started out inspired by learning from los vegas, I was really interested in how they applied the observation of how people use space to architecture, and paired with the iterative nature of Los vegas. However, my background isn’t in architecture, and I was worried that this would become a research paper on architecture.
                    <br><br>
                    My background is actually in Advertising and Journalism, and I realized that the common threat between Journalism, advertising and Venturi’s version of architecture is the need to understand what the User, Subject or consumer is thinking.

                    <p class="text-white-50 text-left">It would be fun to play with AR, there are some new features with persistence that allow you to network information. 
                    <br><br>
                    Theoretically I could conduct and experiment, or make a game, or art piece, that gives people a prompt, like “what does a house look like” and then they could use AR to illustrate a house that matches their mental model, and then we could programmatically compare it to other people’s mental model to illustrate the problem.

            <div class="row mt-5">
            <p>The first step was to establish a baseline, so I asked users to draw a simple house on white paper. I chose a house because it is one of the most ubiquitous symbols to the human expereince, and everyone should have some mental model of a house. It is also something that many people grow up drawing, usually fist with crayons. The way a house looks also depends on the culture that you grew up in. With all these factors in consideration, my guess was that these drawings of homes would each look a little different, be mostly the same, and vary based on the users background. As you can see below, most homes looked exactly how you would imagine them too</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src=prethesis/imgs/researchDrawings/1quinn.jpg>

                <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src=prethesis/imgs/researchDrawings/1quin>
            </div>
            <p>The next step of this experiment was to ask users to draw homes in pairs of 2. I asked them to take turns making simple strokes, one at a time, for four minutes or until they felt like the house was finished. During this excersize, you really began to see the differnces in mental models play out, and how much our backgrounds affect our mental models.</p>

                    <p class="text-white-50">After all my research I decided to take it in the direction of exploring people’s mental models, how they are formed, and how designers can understand them and make software that matches them.

But honestly, I just haven’t been excited about it. It was interesting at first, but I keep going back to some of my original topics that were more interesting, but less specific (like playing with city data, or the one about sex abuse in south east asia )<br><br>

What got me to mental model idea was kind of my fascination with Learning from Las Vegas. And this idea that DSB kind of invented design thinking, and made a case for design thinking before that was ever a thing.
<br><br>
But there is this other component to that book, they drove around for days and collected city data and documented how the city was lit, how large signs were ect… <br><br>
Now-a-days city data is abundant and open-sourced, and I think that there is a case to be made that there is a relationship between how compelling data is, and it’s physicality. And when we can view data in real space, it’s often more interesting.
<br><br>
So I’m thinking about playing around with sexual violence data, or gun data, or really any city data, and pulling it into an augmented reality app that displays it in different ways. <br><br>
In my prototype above, there is just a informational tag where something happened, but I think it would be even more impactful if it were more abstract and artistic and allowed users to “discover what a data point means” based on it’s context.</p>
